This folder contains the files used when building out my capstone project.
The Foursquare-API folder, uses Foursquares developed API to pull location and venue data relevant to Toronto with the purpose of being used to categorize toronto neighbourhoods by most popular venue types.
Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, were how I broke out the development of the project and are combined together to create the Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto.ipynb.

The maps created in the Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto were not rendered on GitHub but have been added to a google drive for viewing: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IA7dxN4tkvryes-h7OfoCAfGfuq3f-be

This is still a work in progress so maps, colours, formatting, and overall design/layout has not been thought out yet.
